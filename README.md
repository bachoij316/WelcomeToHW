# WelcomeToHogwarts!

Welcome to Hogwarts! is a simple website that implemented with using React.js.

App.js,
Images.js,
GryffindorInfo.js,
HufflepuffInfo.js,
RavenclawInfo.js,
SlytherinInfo.js
These are main files I worked on for this project, all the algorithms and logic of state and properties of React.js can be found here.

Main page shows 4 different emblems of houses in Hogwarts and the description of this school.
When the emblems are clicked, the description of each house appear below the emblems with key students from the house,
and the students are also can be clicked and show the description of the students under the students.

All description and information are from 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts
